gfyclean
========
A browser extension to hide everything on gfycat besides the gif.  
Works through initially hiding all elements in css, then removing non-gif elements in the page and reloading.  
Now includes experimental support for Imgur and also works on Firefox for Android.  
Can be found on [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gfyclean/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gfyclean/aekdkigonjjahkfjfclnkcbngnhchdfb).
